      // Just like getters and setters we can intercept some calls to an object.
      // However, beyond get and set we can intercept many, many other things.
      // Here you are going to find get and set, we say they are traps.
      // When there is a call, the call is going to fall into these traps and we have them defined.

      // Let's create an example where we intercept calls to read a property.
      // If the property exists, we return it
      // If it doesn't exist, then we suggest one that might work.

      // For that we'll use an algorithm called Levenshtein. (e.g. window.Levenshtein.get("JavaScript", "JavaScripd"): distance 1)

      const target = {
        red: "Rojo",
        green: "Verde",
        blue: "Azul",
      };

      const handler = {
        get(obj, prop) {
          //obj represents the target, prop the property you are trying to read
          if (prop in obj) {
            return obj[prop];
          }
          const suggestion = Object.keys(obj).find((key) => {
            //if the distance is less or equals 3
            return Levenshtein.get(key, prop) <= 3;
          });

          if (suggestion) {
            console.log(
              `${prop} no se encontró. Quisiste decir ${suggestion}?`
            );
          }
          return obj[prop];
        },
      };

      const p = new Proxy(target, handler); //we want to intercept the target

      console.log(p.red); //Rojo
      console.log(p.greeen); //greeen no se encontró. Quisiste decir green?
      //This proxy could be used in maybe an API that we expose in some library program we are working on,
      // so we help developers to be able to find the value they were looking for. Just like git or npm did.
